# odin-landing-page
This is my landing page project of Odin Project Foundations Course. 
I hope this project helps me on my journey to learn HTML/CSS.
So far I have learn the basics of HTML and CSS including some 
flexbox.  This will probably be a fairly simple page.  I hope
to also work on my commit messages and working with github.
